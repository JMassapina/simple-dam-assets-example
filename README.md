Example asset library for simple-dam
====================================

To help people trying out the simple-dam project, here is a sample asset library!

These pictures are from Flickr, shared with the Creative Commons license.
We assert no Copyright over them and they remain the property of the original authors. (See description on each photo for a link to the flickr page)
You must not use these images except in accordance with their Creative Commons license.

You can see that each file's Folder is shown in the UI and the metadata and thumbnail/preview JPEG are simply next to the original file.

Any software can be used to generate the thumbnail/preview and any file can be used as the asset -- simple-dam doesn't process them in any way.
